# Project 1
+ By: *Greg Retter*
+ Production URL: <http://p1.dwa15gjr.com>

## Outside resources
I used Google for help with trouble shooting and Linux commands.

## Notes for instructor
I had trouble with my first attempt at setting up the digital ocean droplet, then I deleted it and rebuilt the droplet, 
everything worked after that.  My only concern is that my project is named dwa15gjr, my droplet is named dwa15gjr, and 
my domain is named dwa15gjr.  Will this be a problem?
